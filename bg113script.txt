Kobol's Last Gleaming (2)

NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
[Dramatic instrumental music] Just do it.
CRASHDOWN: Boomer, this could be it.
This is the little planet that solves all of our problems.
ELOSHA: What did you see? ROSLIN: A dome-like structure with six roads leading
out of it.
This planet is Kobol.
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.
- They're everywhere! - We're not getting out of here! We need a way to take
out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue.
If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow I will show us the way.
What are you doing, Starbuck? Galactica.
Apollo.
She just jumped away.
- Where the hell did she go? - Home.
[All coughing] CRASHDOWN: This is it! Now, come on! Now come on! Everybody up!
CRASHDOWN: Come on! Go! CRASHDOWN: Come on, move! Out! TYROL: Come on, get him
out of the chair.
CRASHDOWN: Look at me.
TYROL: I got him! CRASHDOWN: For gods' sakes, hurry! TYROL: Come on! TYROL: I
got his legs.
CRASHDOWN: I got him! TYROL: Put him on your shoulder.
[Screaming] CRASHDOWN: Doc! Come on, Doc! Crash! Doc! [Ethereal music] NO.
6: Take my hand.
Gaius, take my hand.
Hey, come on! Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go! Stay with me, Doc! Come on!
CALLY: Come on! Bring him outside! It's gonna blow! [All screaming] CRASHDOWN:
Get down! Stay down.
TYROL: How's he? You okay? We got full tanks.
Let's see what we get.
Getting them down.
[Solemn instrumental music] [Baltar exclaims in pain] CALLY: You all right? You
okay? CRASHDOWN: Get the supplies before they burn.
Go.
CALLY: Right away.
TYROL: We crashed both tanks.
The gas is gone.
It's all gone.
[Solemn instrumental music continues] [Theme music] It's a museum.
So what? It's more than that.
It's the home of the arrow of Apollo.
HELO: What the hell is that? BOOMER 1: You never liked history.
Come on, Helo.
It's supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth.
Earth? What are you talking about? Who's going to Earth? It doesn't even exist.
I'm trying to get back to Galactica.
What I need from you is a way off this planet, and a way back to my ship.
If you don't do that, I'll blow your head off.
Why don't you just shut up for a change? You're only alive because I've kept
you alive.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now.
So whether you like it or not, I'm your only hope of getting off this planet.
So if I were you, I'd take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up
your ass.
We can't move around the city during daylight.
So we hole up and we wait till dark.
[Wind whistling] Unbelievable.
She's crossed the line before, but this is so far beyond the pale She wouldn't
have done this on her own.
She was coerced.
No one coerces Starbuck.
Believe me, I've tried.
Commander, I have the President on the line.
ADAMA: Bear witness.
Put on your headset.
ADAMA: Madam President, moments ago, Lt.
Thrace took the Cylon Raider - on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump.
- Yes.
Do you have any knowledge of this incident? Let's save some time here,
Commander.
The question you really want to ask me is whether or not I asked Lt.
Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica.
ROSLIN: The answer to your question is yes.
[Ominous instrumental music] - You and I had talked about this.
- Yes, we had.
ADAMA: We both decided it was a military decision.
My responsibility as President is first and foremost to protect and preserve
this fleet and its future.
In the end, that outweighs any other consideration.
It has to.
By taking the Raider you've placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct
danger.
ROSLIN: I'm very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol.
I am also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in if I ignore
the pursuit of this arrow.
I'm going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President.
ROSLIN: No.
Then I'm terminating your presidency as of this moment.
Commander Adama, I will exercise the authority of this office until I am unable
to do so.
So if you want to stage a coup you're gonna have to come over here and arrest
me.
- I don't want any bloodshed.
- Of course you don't.
Neither do I.
Neither does the press.
They're here, by the way.
[Whispering] The press.
They're recording every minute.
[Ominous instrumental music intensifies] - What is it, Captain? - Isolate
Colonial One.
Mr.
Gaeta.
Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial One immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare a strike team.
As long as she's President, she's dangerous.
If she can turn Starbuck against us, she's capable of anything.
Yes, sir.
- She's bluffing.
- Well, let's hope so.
There's also a Cylon base ship out there to deal with.
Leave that to me.
This government survived a Cylon attack.
It will survive William Adama.
ROSLIN: I think he's bluffing.
But just in case, we need to be prepared.
I know their security detail.
They will defend that ship.
We'll have to take her down compartment by compartment.
ADAMA: Mr.
Gaeta? GAETA: Sir.
Am I correct in assuming that I have two Cylon transponders left? Yes, sir.
But only one of them is fully functional.
One will do.
Now I need a pilot.
BOOMER: Sir.
ADAMA: As you were.
- How are you feeling? - It looks worse than it is, sir.
Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot.
I'm ready, sir.
I have a very special mission for you and I won't kid around.
- It's high risk, extremely high risk.
- I understand.
ADAMA: I need you to light-jump to Kobol and take care of this base star.
We're placing a Cylon transponder aboard your Raptor.
In theory, it should allow you to approach the base star without getting fired
upon.
But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial Raptors once we're in visual range.
For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured
Raptor.
ADAMA: Once you're inside the defence perimeter I need you to make them think
you want to dock.
You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay and then jump back home
immediately.
Do you understand? I understand.
I can do it, sir.
I know I can.
You have to.
Yes, sir.
[Fast-paced instrumental music] [Starbuck panting] [Groaning] STARBUCK: This
doesn't look good.
Please tell me this was not all for nothing.
[Exclaiming in exasperation] I'm good.
I am really good.
I'm home.
Wow, I'm home.
[Monitor beeping] [Ominous instrumental music] Gaeta, please tell me that
you're right about this transponder thing.
[Ominous instrumental music intensifies] [Boomer 1 tapping foot] Stop.
Stop that.
I'm nervous.
Like anything scares you.
Things scare me, Helo.
I have feelings.
You have software.
I don't know if you can hear this or not, Helo but what we had between us was
important.
It was very important.
- Why? - Because it was the next step.
Because it brings us closer to God.
Don't mock the gods.
It's a human belief.
I'm human.
They're our gods.
But beyond that, I just want you to know that I genuinely feel something for
you.
I don't care.
I don't love you.
I loved what I thought was you.
Helo, I think there's something else that you should know.
[Climactic instrumental music] I'm pregnant.
APOLLO: [On radio] Galactica, Apollo.
We have visual on Colonial One.
Tell Apollo he's cleared to begin the assault to contact us when he has
soft-seal on the hull.
Aye, sir.
Commander, Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.
Put them through down here.
ADAMA: Boomer, Galactica Actual.
I just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and I have complete faith in the
both of you.
Thank you, Actual.
We won't let you down.
Racetrack, start the jump clock.
[Beeping] Clock is running.
APOLLO: Galactica.
Apollo.
We have soft-seal.
I know Commander Adama and I'm counting on the fact that when push comes to
shove, he is the kind of man who will not want bloodshed.
Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place.
Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold? There is room in the cargo
hold and I implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians.
This is my choice.
ROSLIN: This is my choice.
- You do not have to come with me.
- We stand with our president.
[Phone buzzing] BILLY: Yes? Right.
Security commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull.
The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
Get the President on the line.
[Solemn instrumental music] You think this thing is working? [Electronic
beeping] We're about to find out.
[Exclaiming in relie] - I guess so.
- Yeah.
[Clearing throat] - How are we doing on that? - It's not responding, sir.
Are you even trained to use this thing? CRASHDOWN: How's he doing, Chief?
[Tyrol sighs heavily] Not doing so good.
I don't now if his lungs are burned or what.
Well, he's a tough kid.
He's gonna pull through.
Get those wounds looked at, Chief.
TYROL: Yeah.
Lieutenant? TYROL: Shouldn't we be moving out? - Do you have a plan for
tactical deployment? - Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high
ground.
It'll be our best chance of being seen by a search party.
High ground is also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons.
TYROL: They're flying around, sir.
They might land the troops before we get rescued.
CRASHDOWN: That's true.
TYROL: Yeah.
Sir, if I may suggest that we take cover on the ground maybe somewhere we won't
be seen from the air? Okay, yeah.
Chief, that's Carry on, Chief.
Launch the nuke and prepare to jump.
[Tense instrumental music] Frack.
What? The bomb release is jammed.
I can't free it.
[Alarm beeping] We can dock inside the ship.
- Excuse me? - They think we're Cylons.
They'll let us dock.
We can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself.
- It'll work.
I know it.
- Oh, my gods.
[Tense instrumental music continues] [Racetrack sighing in fear] TYROL: Petard,
Felix? TYROL: Wanna give me a hand here, please? FELIX: Yes, sir.
TYROL: Cally, how's he doing? CALLY: Not good, sir.
TYROL: Get a blanket on him.
Keep him warm.
NO.
6: How are you? [Solemn instrumental music] BALTAR: Alive.
You saved me.
You saved my life.
- Care to return the favour? - Are you in need of saving? You wondered why you
were chosen? Why God chose you above all other humans to survive and serve His
purpose? Now is the time to find out why.
[Solemn instrumental music continues] [Guns cocking] [Tense instrumental music]
Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer.
Bring us out of the darkness and into the light.
Give us the strength to show mercy to those who are merciless The President
says she will not yield.
hearts that they may find peace The President says she will not yield.
So be it.
[Whispering] Come on, D, tell me he's not actually gonna do this.
[Whispering] Tell me she's not gonna make him do it.
Redeem our hearts that they may find peace in the midst of war.
[Loud banging] [Whispering] What's going on? They're in.
ROSLIN: Quickly.
[Tense instrumental music continues] Billy? Billy? Sir, they're in.
[Suspenseful instrumental music] [Solemn instrumental music] Pretty, isn't it?
[Starbuck groans] Hello, Lieutenant.
Something I can help you with? [lntense instrumental music] [Eerie instrumental
music] I'm setting her down.
[Rumbling] Open the hatch.
BOOMER: I'll release the bomb.
BOOMER: Keep the engines ready for takeoff the second I get back.
- Yes, sir.
- Close the hatch after me.
- lf I'm not back in five minutes, just go.
- You got it.
[Hatch door opening] [Hatch door closing] [Ominous instrumental music]
[Breathing heavily] BOOMER: Oh, my God.
[Tense instrumental music] NO.
6: Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant.
Like what we've done with the place? [lntense instrumental music] [Starbuck
grunting] [Starbuck exclaiming in pain] [lntense instrumental music continues]
[Beeping] BOOMER 2: Sharon.
[Chilling instrumental music] RACETRACK: What the frack are you doing? Where
are you going? Son of a bitch.
[Panting] Okay, okay.
ALL: Sharon.
[Climactic instrumental music] This isn't happening.
Come on, Starbuck.
[Starbuck grunting] [Gripping instrumental music] Got anything left? [Starbuck
exclaiming in pain] [Starbuck screams maniacally] Starbuck? Madam President, no
one needs to get hurt here.
Then why don't you get off my ship, Colonel? I'm placing you under arrest.
- No.
We're not doing this.
- I'm in command here, Captain.
- Colonel, this is wrong.
- You're relieved.
Fall back.
Madam President, I wish to APOLLO: Men, lay down your weapons.
TIGH: Have you lost your fracking mind? Colonel, tell these Marines to fall
back.
[Tense instrumental music] TIGH: This is mutiny.
You know that.
APOLLO: Yes, I do.
APOLLO: But you can tell my father I'm listening to my instincts.
And my instincts tell me we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the
President makes a bad decision.
Put your guns down.
- Madam President, stand back.
- Put your gun down, Captain.
I will not have bloodshed, neither your men nor my people on the Colonial One.
Put your gun down.
All of you.
Please, put your gun down.
TIGH: Let's go.
MARINE: Let's go, Captain.
Let's go.
[Chilling instrumental music] BOOMER 2: You're confused.
And scared.
But it's okay.
I'm not a Cylon.
I'm Sharon Valerii.
I was born on Troy.
My parents were Katherine and Abraham Valerii.
You can't fight destiny, Sharon.
It catches up with you.
No matter what you do.
BOOMER 3: Don't worry about us.
BOOMER 4: We'll see you again.
- We love you, Sharon.
- And we always will.
[Tense instrumental music] RACETRACK: Boomer! BOOMER: Come on, let's go!
RACETRACK: What took you so long? BOOMER: Go! RACETRACK: Where's your helmet?
Go back.
Don't turn around.
[Ship rumbling] [Beeping] [Ominous instrumental music] He put his weapon right
to my head.
Said to tell you he was following his instincts whatever the hell that means.
ADAMA: Bring him here.
TIGH: What about Roslin? We put her in the brig.
Dradis contacts! It's Boomer and Racetrack, sir.
Put them on the speakers.
BOOMER: [On PA system] Galactica, Boomer.
Mission accomplished.
Repeat: Mission accomplished.
The base star is history! [All cheering and clapping] There's some good news.
Bring them home, D.
It's good to hear your voice, Boomer.
Come on home.
[Starbuck groaning] [Starbuck exclaiming in pain] HELO: It's okay.
I can't believe it.
You are like the last person I expected to see.
[Starbuck panting heavily] I could say the same thing about you.
- You okay? - Yeah, thank you.
[Starbuck exclaiming in pain] I missed you.
Hey, I [Starbuck panting hysterically] STARBUCK: She's a Cylon! HELO: No! You
can't! She's pregnant.
[Screaming] No! [Light orchestral music] - I know this place.
- Of course you do.
Go inside.
[Orchestral music swells] I don't understand.
Life has a melody, Gaius.
A rhythm of notes that become your existence once they're played in harmony
with God's plan.
It's time to do your part and realise your destiny.
Which is what, exactly? You are the guardian and protector of the new
generation of God's children.
The first member of our family will be with us soon, Gaius.
It's time to make your choice.
But I don't understand what you're talking about.
I don't understand.
Come.
See the face of the shape of things to come.
[Orchestral music continues] Isn't she beautiful, Gaius? [Baltar exclaiming in
wonder] Open the cell.
Close the cell.
MARINE: Well done, Lieutenant.
BOOMER: Thanks.
GAETA: Hey, nice work.
BOOMER: Thanks.
What's going on? GAETA: A lot happened while you were gone.
GAETA: Congrats.
BOOMER: Thanks.
Congratulations to both of you.
You carried out a very difficult and dangerous mission and you did it despite
any personal misgivings you may or may not have had.
And for that, I'm very proud.
ADAMA: Thank you.
RACETRACK: Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
[Gripping instrumental music] [Haunting music] APOLLO: Someone get a doctor!
[Alarm blaring] Hold his head.
