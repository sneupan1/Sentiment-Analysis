Battlestar Galactica s01e01 Episode Script

33

NARRATOR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
BALTAR: Now you tell me you're a machine.
The robot.
You knew I wanted access to defence mainframe.
Do you have any idea what they'd do to me if they find out? NO.
6: Get down.
[Glass shattering] ADAMA: Moments ago, this ship received word that the Cylon
attack against our home worlds is underway.
As of this moment, we are at war.
All right, we can take three more people.
Giving up my seat.
[Tense instrumental music] I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious
mind playing itself out during my waking states.
So I'm in your head? [Tense instrumental music] No.
There're maybe Cylon agents living among us.
Some may not even know they're Cylons at all.
They could be sleeper agents programmed to perfectly impersonate human beings
until activation.
[Clock ticking] [lntense instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music]
[Electronic beeping] And one minute to mark.
[Tense instrumental music continues] [Electronic beeping] [Tense instrumental
music continues] [Electronic beeping] [Tense instrumental music continues] God
has a plan for you, Gaius.
He has a plan for everything and everyone.
Gaius? Are you even listening to me? [Tense instrumental music intensifies]
PILOT: Passengers, 30 seconds to mark.
ROSLIN: Planet.
Men.
Women.
Age.
You know what? Do this after the jump.
It's all right.
[Sighs] [Tense instrumental music continues] [Clock ticking] You have to
believe in something.
BALTAR: I believe in a world that I can and do understand.
A rational universe.
Explained through rational means.
I love you.
That's not rational.
[Tense instrumental music continues] I know.
No, but you're not rational.
You're also not really here.
Neither am I.
[Doorbell rings] PILOT: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen our 33 minutes
are almost up once again.
Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump.
Thank you.
[Clock ticking] Cutting it a little close this time, aren't we, Billy? Pilot
says he's had to reboot the FTL computer again.
[Tense instrumental music] CALLY: Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why
isn't it 34, 35 TYROL: Cally.
CALLY: What? Shut up.
[Tense instrumental music continues] Fifteen seconds.
Sir, Jump 237 underway.
Fifty-three ships have jumped.
Ten still reporting trouble with their FTL drives including Colonial One.
We're getting slower.
[Electronic beeping] Maybe this time.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies] [Beeping] [Rapid electronic beeping]
[Alarm ringing] [Dramatic instrumental music] GAETA: Dradis contact.
It's the Cylons.
- Damn it.
- Not this time, maybe the next.
Got another idea for the next cycle.
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again.
However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily.
BALTAR: Five days now.
[Tense instrumental music] There are limits to the human body, the human mind.
Tolerances that you can't push beyond.
Well, those are facts provable facts.
Everyone has a limit.
All right, you know the drill, people.
Scatter formation.
APOLLO: Keep them off the civies and don't stray beyond the recovery line.
[Guns firing] Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
You've got a red light right there.
[Electronic crackling] [Rapid beeping] DUALLA: We have a hit on the starboard
bow.
Away the damage control parties.
Basestar is launching raiders.
[Tense instrumental music] Colonial One is ready to jump.
All civilian ships away, including Colonial One.
Recover fighters.
Stand by to jump.
Combat landings.
[Tense instrumental music continues] - All fighters aboard, sir.
- Execute jump.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies] Jump 237 complete.
All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir.
TIGH: Start the clock.
And let's start prepping for the next jump.
Clock is running.
Thirty-three minutes.
Mark.
TYROL: You have 32 minutes, people.
[Suspenseful instrumental music] [Sighing] NO.
6: You know you're not safe.
No, of course not.
The Cylons will follow us again as they have the last 237 times.
NO.
6: You're right, you know.
There are limits.
- Eventually, you'll make a mistake.
- And then you'll kill us all.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
But not for another 33 minutes.
[Clock ticking] [Theme music] [Tense instrumental music] [Clock ticking] ADAMA:
I want to try something new this time.
Divide the fleet into six groups.
And they jump [Adama sighs] ADAMA: And they jump two more times and on the
fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates.
TIGH: Twenty-four jumps to plot, we're breaking our humps calculating one jump
every 33 minutes.
Get off my jacket.
- You eating this? - Not anymore.
APOLLO: Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day so
double-check your undercarriage before Look, you all have done this 237 times.
You know what to do.
No mistakes.
And let's make it to 238.
Good luck and be careful out there.
[Solemn instrumental music] Can you do me a favour? Tell Capt.
Apollo he owes me one wing.
DAVE: You got it, dude.
No, Cally, there's three.
I know there's three.
- Can you check it again for me, please? - Yeah.
Let's get some of them starting to work.
TYROL: We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.
Boomer.
Heard the latest? They say Cylons look like us now.
- Primary fuel? - Primary fuel 2893 KRG.
Marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because
they actually thought that he was a Cylon.
You know what? I don't give a frak.
Red light on the number four thruster.
Go make a visual ID.
See if it's blocked.
- Right.
- "Right.
" A little rough on your new ECO, don't you think? He's not my ECO.
He's some refugee from Triton that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you.
- Helo's gone, Sharon.
- I didn't ask you that, either.
Sorry.
- Colony? - Saggitaron.
How many have you got? SOCINUS: We can't transmit photos yet.
If you want, you can leave them with us or you can put them on the board
outside.
Sorry.
DUALLA: Thanks.
SOCINUS: Next.
SOCINUS: Colony? [Sombre instrumental music] [Sombre instrumental music
intensifies] [Sighing] Update on the headcount, Madam President.
How did we lose 300? There were some overcounts a few deaths from wounds and a
few missing during the last attack.
[Grave instrumental music] Do you want children, Gaius? [lntense instrumental
music] Let me think about it for a minute.
No.
Procreation is one of God's commandments.
Really? I'm sure some day if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you with a lovely
little walking toaster of your very own.
I want us to have a child, Gaius.
BALTAR: You can't be serious.
- It's Dr.
Amarak.
- What was that? I'm so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking.
You were just saying? I was just saying that a Dr.
Amarak - has requested to speak with the President.
- Dr.
Amarak.
I see.
You know him? Have you always been able to multitask like this? Yes.
I used to work with him at the Ministry of Defence.
It says here that he's uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons
were able to defeat colonial defences.
I was always a little worried he was on to us.
Were you going to speak to him? BALTAR: Perhaps I should speak to him if you're
busy.
BILLY: I think he wanted to speak directly with the President.
It sounded urgent.
It must be very important.
Maybe something about a certain traitor in the President's inner circle?
There's not enough time before we jump.
I want him on board first thing during the next cycle.
Thank you, Doctor.
- I'd say you have a serious problem.
- lf I can help.
He's a strange one, isn't he? [Eerie instrumental music] [Suspenseful
instrumental music] [Helo panting] [Continues panting] [Explosions] [Robots
grunting] [Robots screeching] [Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
[Screaming] [Helo panting] [Ticking] MAN: [Over PA] Landing base Team Alpha,
check three.
DUALLA: Can you see it? Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
That makes 61.
Have the docs start pumping them up with stimulants and get them back on the
line.
ADAMA: Pilots, too.
DUALLA: Fuel report.
One out of every three, every other cycle.
TIGH: That's gonna come back and bite us on the ass.
ADAMA: We have too much work and not enough people to do it.
DUALLA: Fuel report.
- I've already signed one of these.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Comm traffic two from the President.
- Is this my 10 minutes or this yours? - Yours.
I took 10 last time.
See you guys in combat.
I believe it was your 10 minutes.
If the old man's so tired he can't remember, then it's his turn.
- You see the note from the XO? - Yeah, I saw it.
No way.
APOLLO: Kara, everyone else STARBUCK: I don't fly with stims.
They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
- Come on, Kara, give me a break.
Just - Why are we arguing about this? APOLLO: I have no idea.
Neither do I.
You're the CAG, act like one.
What the hell does that mean? It means that you're still acting like you're
everyone's best friend.
We're not friends, you're the CAG.
"Be careful out there"? Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot Cylons out
of the frakking sky.
STARBUCK: "Good hunting" is what you say.
And now, one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take
her pills.
So she either says, "Yes, sir" and obeys a direct order or you smack her in the
mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay and you make her take those
pills.
[Kara laughs] Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.
You're damn right you're glad.
So, do I have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant? No, sir.
I'll take my pills.
Perfect.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
DISPATCHER: Pilots to ready room for pre-flight briefing.
Pilots to ready room.
What? [Rain pattering] [Gasping] [Dramatic instrumental music] [Tense
instrumental music] [Panting] [Gun cocking] [Gasping] Jump 238 complete.
ADAMA: Start the clock.
GAETA: [Over PA] Thirty-three minutes.
Mark.
All civilian ships present and [Electronic beeping] Strike my last.
One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir.
TIGH: Which one? DUALLA: The Olympic Carrier.
DUALLA: Commercial passenger vessel.
ADAMA: Were they left behind? DUALLA: I think I accounted for all civilian
ships before we left.
You think? Did you or didn't you? [Electronic beeping] They're not logged in,
sir.
I think they may have been left behind.
How many people aboard ship? You're telling me we left over 1,300 people to die
at the hands of the Cylons? It may not have been her fault, sir.
It may have been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates
or the Cylons destroyed the ship before the jump Or 50 other things may have
happened.
The point is we don't know what the hell did happen.
Yes, we're tired.
Yes, there's no relief.
Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us time after time and yes, we are still
expected to do our jobs.
We make mistakes, people die.
There aren't many of us left.
Carry on.
[Melancholic instrumental music] Okay.
Next crisis? [Billy sighs dejectedly] - List of calls? - Yes.
But first, where's the doctor who's supposed to be on board? What's his name? -
Dr.
Amarak.
- Yes.
Dr.
Amarak.
Oh.
He was on the Olympic Carrier.
[Seagulls cawing] NO.
6: God is watching out for you, Gaius.
The universe is a vast and complex system.
Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur.
Indeed they are to be expected.
- It's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
- Dr.
Amarak posed a threat to you.
Now he's gone.
Logic says there's a connection.
BALTAR: A connection, maybe.
But not God.
There is no God or gods, singular or plural.
There are no large invisible men, or women for that matter in the sky taking a
personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.
Be careful.
That which God gives, he can also take away.
[Sombre instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music] Fifteen seconds.
[Electronic beeping] Maybe this time.
Dradis? No enemy contacts.
Keep the clock running.
What do you think? I think we wait.
[Tense instrumental music continues] [Tense instrumental music intensifies]
[Beeping] [Sighs] Get me the President.
Why this time? Was it something that you did? We had a new plan, but we didn't
have time to implement it yet.
We lost a ship during the last cycle, the Olympic Carrier.
Does that have something to do with it? ADAMA: Possibly.
[Tense instrumental music continues] Are you there? Yeah, I'm here.
What do we do now, Commander? I've got people on the verge over here.
We're gonna go to Condition Two.
We have to take advantage of this time - and let our people get some rest.
- All right.
And how long do we stay at Condition Two? Until I'm satisfied they're not going
to return.
ADAMA: It's a military decision.
It is.
I know that.
You're right and I defer to your decision.
And, Commander let your men and women know how grateful I am for the job that
they are doing, please.
Thank them for me.
ADAMA: Thank you, Madam President.
ADAMA: Thank you.
ADAMA: Contact Apollo.
ADAMA: Tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet and order his other
pilots to land immediately.
All right, people, you heard the order.
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me.
We'll fly the first CAP.
APOLLO: I want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks.
APOLLO: Three-hour rotation.
STARBUCK: Hey, Apollo not that I'm not honoured by being chosen to sit in my
cockpit for the next three hours but APOLLO: But why you? - Take a guess.
- Because I'm on drugs? [Chuckling] You got it.
This patrol is 100% stimulated.
CRASHDOWN: Anyone else feels like they've got frakking ants crawling behind
their eyeballs? APOLLO: How about you, Boomer? Doc tells me you're holding up
better than anybody in the squadron.
BOOMER: I'm tired like everybody else.
APOLLO: You never seem it.
STARBUCK: Because she's a Cylon.
You're gonna make me come over there and kick your ass.
Okay.
Let's set up a patrol here before somebody gets hurt.
APOLLO: Follow me.
STARBUCK: Copy that, Apollo.
A couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet TIGH: right about now.
ADAMA: You deserve it.
Thank you.
The truth is all this has me feeling more alive than I have in years.
You look that way, too.
It's good to you without the cup in your hand.
Don't start.
I know there's a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you weren't
feeling as good as you were.
If the crew doesn't hate the XO, then he's not doing his job.
Besides, got to make the old man look good.
I always look good.
- Did you look in a mirror? - Seriously GAETA: Sir.
it's one thing to push a crew, it's another to break them.
[Loud beeping] Dradis contact.
Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.
Getting recognition signal.
MAN: Initiating response flash mode.
Alpha, alpha.
It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.
ADAMA: Is that confirmed? DUALLA: It's confirmed, sir.
[Suspenseful instrumental music] Thank the gods.
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues] Action stations.
[Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies] Put the fleet into Condition One.
I want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes.
TIGH: Mr.
Gaeta.
GAETA: Sir? Restart the clock.
Thirty-three minutes.
[Electronic beeping] - Hope you're wrong.
- So do I.
GAETA: Clock is running.
ADAMA: So do I.
[Beeping] No.
It's all wrong.
If they were left behind, why didn't the Cylons destroy them? And why are they
showing up now? It's God's punishment for your lack of faith.
That's just great, that is.
A more logical and useful explanation, please.
All right.
The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated by Cylon agents.
[Ominous instrumental music] They've been tracking the ship all along.
No.
Then that means Logically, in order for you to survive the Olympic Carrier
should be destroyed.
BOOMER: Olympic Carrier this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer.
I have you in visual contact.
Please respond to this channel.
Over.
MAN: Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier.
We have you in visual contact.
Thank the Lords of Kobol.
You don't know how relieved we are to see you.
BOOMER: Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
Can I ask about your whereabouts? MAN: We had trouble with our FTL drive.
Took us almost three hours to fix.
ADAMA: Have Boomer ask them how they escaped the Cylons.
BOOMER: Olympic Carrier, Boomer.
I've been directed to ask how you escaped from the Cylons.
MAN: They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping.
I thought we were goners, then they just broke off.
Someone must've been watching out for us.
BOOMER: Roger that.
MAN: One other thing, Boomer.
I've got a Dr.
Amarak on board who has an urgent matter to discuss with the President.
- He's been driving me crazy.
- Can you be more specific? MAN: I can't.
He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst and he's unwilling to
share more than that.
Madam President, I strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless
communication with that ship right away.
Why? Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The Olympic
Carrier is still flying because the Cylons let them survive.
They've been tracking that ship all along.
- There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now! - Calm down.
Start over.
Please, Madam President, I implore you.
Listen to me.
Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send via broadcast
signal another computer virus to affect our ship shortly before they blow us
all up.
Commander Adama, are you on the line? Cut off the speakers.
Put her through on the line.
ADAMA: Yes, Madam President.
And I'm inclined to agree with Dr.
Baltar.
Good.
So do I.
Thank the gods you're with us.
God's got nothing to do with this.
[Tense instrumental music] [Beeping] DUALLA: Boomer, Galactica.
Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the Olympic Carrier.
No further voice contact is authorised.
Roger that, Galactica.
DUALLA: Boomer, Galactica.
Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light.
Message begins: Maintain present position.
DUALLA: Do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet until further notice.
Message ends.
I'm getting a bad feeling about where this is headed.
So am I.
If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
[Suspenseful instrumental music] I don't think they got the message, Apollo.
Yeah, I see it.
Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority.
Warn them to stop their engines immediately.
I suggest that we evacuate the passengers, then destroy the ship.
Solves the problem if they're tracking the ship.
What if they're tracking one of the passengers? BOOMER: Olympic Carrier you are
ordered to stop your engines immediately.
Acknowledge.
BOOMER: Apollo, they're not responding.
APOLLO: Are you using the same channel? BOOMER: Yeah, but suddenly nobody's
home.
Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.
Copy that.
[Ship's guns firing] [Suspenseful instrumental music continues] Boomer, let
Galactica know we have a problem out here.
Commander, message from Boomer.
The Olympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir.
They're refusing all orders to stop.
[Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies] BOOMER: Galactica, they're still
not responding and continue to head towards the fleet.
Request instructions.
Order the fleet to execute Jump 240.
Get us between that ship and the fleet.
GAETA: Commander! Dradis contact.
Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts.
[Rapid electronic beeping] It's the Cylons.
[Dramatic instrumental music] CRASHDOWN: The Cylons are on an intercept course.
They'll be in weapons range within two minutes.
[Alarm beeping] Radiological alarm! - Radiological alarm! - From where? [Alarm
beeping] The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.
Madam President, we have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier immediately.
There are 1,300 people on that ship.
ADAMA: We don't know that.
The Cylons may have captured them already.
She's not going to do it.
She has to do it.
- It's not her decision, Gaius.
- No? NO.
6: It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.
Look, at this point there's no choice.
It's either them or us.
Repent of your sins and accept his true love and you will be saved.
[Tense instrumental music] I repent.
Then I'll repent.
[Tense instrumental music intensifies] I repent.
Do it.
BOOMER: We have new orders.
We're directed to destroy the Olympic Carrier and return to Galactica.
It's a civilian ship.
APOLLO: Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.
[Sombre instrumental music] APOLLO: I don't see anybody in there, do you? The
Cylons will be here any second.
If we're going to do this, then just do it.
Starbuck, form up with me.
APOLLO: We'll make one pass from astern.
STARBUCK: Lee, what if you're wrong? [Sombre instrumental music continues]
STARBUCK: Lee, come on.
Okay, fire on my mark.
No frakking way, Lee.
Lee? Come on! [Tense instrumental music] Mark.
[Ship's guns firing] [Rain pattering] [Helo grunting defiantly] Are you alive?
[Panting] Agathon, Karl C.
Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet.
- PK-789-9348.
- I know who you are, Helo.
It's all right.
I'm a friend.
[Gunshot] [No.
6 gasps] [Solemn instrumental music] [Both gasping] Sharon? HELO: What are you
doing here? BOOMER: Can you walk? [Helo grunting] Yeah, I think so.
- What are you doing here, I thought - Let's move, mister.
[Solemn instrumental music continues] [Dramatic instrumental music] APOLLO:
Sir.
ADAMA: Son.
[Adama sighs] I gave the order.
It's my responsibility.
I pulled the trigger.
That's mine.
[Sombre instrumental music] BILLY: Madam President? BILLY: Madam President? I'm
sorry, you were saying something? Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.
- At least you know it was the right choice.
- The right choice.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I think I'd like some time alone, please.
BILLY: Of course.
[Sombre instrumental music continues] What is it? - Update on the headcount? -
Subtract how many? Actually, you can add one.
A baby was born this morning on the Rising Star.
A boy.
- A baby.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
[Serene instrumental music] [Theme music]
